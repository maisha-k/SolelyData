The goal of **SolelyData** is to provide tools for cleaning, organizing, and visualizing datasets efficiently. This package is inspired by the idea of "cleaning the sole" of messy data, ensuring it's ready for analysis.

## Background and Motivation

The **SolelyData** package was developed to address common challenges in data cleaning and preprocessing. Whether you're working with messy datasets from real-world sources or preparing data for advanced analysis, **SolelyData** provides tools to make the process faster, easier, and more reliable.

Key motivations for developing this package:

-   **Time Efficiency**: Minimize manual intervention by automating repetitive data cleaning tasks.

-   **Data Quality**: Ensure your datasets are free from inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting errors.

-   **Versatility**: Designed to handle diverse datasets, including animal shelter data, survey responses, and other real-world records.

This package is especially useful for analysts, researchers, and data scientists who want to focus on extracting insights rather than spending hours cleaning data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of SolelyData like so:

`devtools::install_github("maisha-k/SolelyData")`

## About the Data

The **SolelyData** package includes a built-in dataset sourced from the **King County Animal Shelter** dataset, which is publicly available on [King County's Open Data Portal](https://data.kingcounty.gov/Pets/Lost-found-adoptable-pets/yaai-7frk/about_data). This dataset provides valuable insights into animal shelter operations, including information about lost, found, and adoptable pets in the King County region.

#### Why Animal Shelter Data?

The **King County Animal Shelter** dataset was chosen as a built-in example because it represents a real-world scenario with diverse challenges, including:

-   **Categorical Data**: Fields like animal type and breed require standardization and typo correction.

-   **Date Validations**: Intake and outcome dates need to be consistent and accurate.

-   **Missing Values**: Some records may have incomplete fields, highlighting the importance of handling missing data effectively.

The dataset offers a practical example to demonstrate how **SolelyData** can be used to clean, organize, and prepare data for analysis.

## Functions in the Package

Here’s an overview of the core functions available in the package:

-   `solotypo` : Identify single-occurrence values (typos) in a dataset and suggest corrections based on string similarity.
-   `validate_dates` : Validate date columns in your dataset to ensure all entries conform to the correct format and fall within a specified range
-   `flagweirdanimals`: Identify rows with unusual or unexpected categorical values based on a predefined list of valid options.
-   `flagnonnumeric` : Identify non-numeric values in a numeric column and optionally replace them with NA.
-   `missingsum` : Identify columns with missing values and summarize their counts or proportions.
-   `plot_completeness` : Create intuitive visualizations to identify patterns of missing data.

## Examples

You can find these and more code examples for exploring SolelyData in `vignettes("intro-to-solelydata")`.

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(SolelyData)

data <- data.frame(
  Fruit = c("apple", "APPLE", "appl", "orange","orange" ,"banana", "BANANA", "banan"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

solotypo(data, column = "Fruit")

```
